The code:

```ruby
name = 'Bob'
save_name = name
name.upcase!
puts name, save_name
```
will print out:

```ruby
BOB
BOB
```

The reason for this is that when `save_name = name` was processed, `save_name`
and `name` were set to point to the same space in memory. When `upcase!` was 
invoked on the `name` variable, the string 'Bob' at that space in memory was  
mutated in place.
